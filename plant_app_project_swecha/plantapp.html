document.getElementById('information').innerHTML="Rice plant is named as Oryza sativa, belongs to family Graminae or Poaceae. It is an annual herb, having smooth, hollow erect culms 0.5 to 1.5 meters high and an extensive fibrous root system. Tillers or side shoots arise from the basal node of the main culm. The leaves are borne at an angle on the stem. They have linear blades, sheathing leaf bases and ligules at the junction of blade and sheath.Rice is water loving plant which is grown in north-eastern states, all rounds the year if water is available either though rain or irrigation.Rice needs relatively high temperature ranging between for optimum growth and development of plants. Depending upon the temperature requirement rice crops grown during kharif.Rice is grown on all sorts of heavy soil type’s clay loamy of alluviuol in nature, which have high water holding capacity."

document.getElementById('information').innerHTML="Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well.The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum productivity."

document.getElementById('plant').src="images/Millets.jpg";
document.getElementById('information').innerHTML="Millets require warm temperatures for germination and development and are sensitive to frost. For these reasons, they are normally planted from mid-June to mid-July in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Optimum soil temperatures for seed germination are between 68 and 86°F. Millets grow well on well-drained loamy soils. They will not tolerate water-logged soils or extreme drought. Proso millet does not perform well on coarse, sandy soils."

function coffee()

document.getElementById('plant2').src="images/coffee.jpg";
document.getElementById('information2').innerHTML="Climatological factor like rainfall, temperature, elevation and aspect can influence economic production of coffee much more than soil factors. Soil should be deep, well drained, slightly acidic in reaction and rich in organic matter content.Seeds should be sown with the flat side facing the soil at a distance of 1.5 – 2.5cm from one another in regular rows. A thin layer of fine soil is then spread. The bed is covered with a layer of about 5cm of paddy straw. The beds are watered daily and protected from direct sunlight by an overhead pandal. The seeds germinate in about 45 days. The seedlings are then transplanted to secondary nursery beds or raising polybag plants.Spacing for arabica and robusta coffee is 2 to 2.5m and 2.5 to 4m respectively on either way."

document.getElementById('information2').innerHTML="  Tea is exacting in its climatic requirements. The temperature may vary from 16 to 320C and annual rainfall should be 125 to 150 cm, which is well distributed over 8-9 months in a year. The atmospheric humidity should be always around 80% during most of the time. Very dry atmosphere is not congenial for tea.Weeds will be a problem in young and pruned fields. Manual weeding is never recommended in tea lest more soil erosion and damage to surface roots and collar regions.Plucking consists of harvesting 2 to 3 leaves and a bud. It is the most labour intensive operation in a tea industry and also decides the yield and quality of made tea."

document.getElementById('information2').innerHTML=" The coconut palm is found to grow under varying climatic and soil conditions. It is essentially a tropical plant, growing most!y between 20° N and 20° S latitudes. Coconut is propagated through seedlings raised from selected seednuts. Generally 9 to 12 month old seedlings are used for planting. Select seedlings, which have 6-8 leaves and 10-12 cm collar girth when they are 9-12 month old. Early splitting of leaves is another criteria in the selection of coconut seedling.Shallow soils with underlying hard rock, low lying areas subject to water stagnation and clayey soils are to be avoided. Proper supply of moisture either through well distributed rainfall or through irrigation should be ensured before planting."

document.getElementById('information3').innerHTML=" Being a tropical crop, banana requires warm, humid and rainy climate. The optimum temperature range is 10 to 400C and the relative humidity is 90% or above. It is highly susceptible to frost and cannot tolerate arid conditions. Strong desiccating winds cause considerable reduction in the growth of the plant and yield and quality of fruits.Banana is a heavy feeder crop/. Therefore, fertility of soil is very important. Rich, well drained, fertile, free working, soils with plenty of organic matter are best suited for cultivation. The optimum range of pH of soil should be 6 to 8.Planting of banana is done by two methods viz. Pit method and furrow method. Planting is done from February to May Harvesting of banana is done 12 to 15 months after planting in dwarf and 15 to 18 months after planting in tall varieties. "

Rain or cloudy weather at the time of flowering causes considerable damage to mango as it adversely affects flowering and fruit set and increases incidence of pests and diseases. It grows where temperature drops as low as 00C. And as high as 460C. However, it thrives best at temperature around 270C. It grows well both in low (25 cm) and high (250 cm) rainfall areas.
